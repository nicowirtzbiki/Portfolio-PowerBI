# 📊 Performance Dashboard

## 🌟 Overview

The **Performance Dashboard** is an interactive tool designed to help businesses analyze key financial metrics and make data-driven decisions. Users can dynamically switch between three core metrics: **Gross Profit, Quantity, and Sales**, as well as filter data by year. The dashboard titles and chart labels update accordingly to reflect the selected metric, ensuring clear and intuitive visualizations.

## ❓ Problem Statement

This project was developed for a company specializing in 🌿 plant sales. The goal is to provide insights into business performance by tracking **revenue, profit, and sales quantity** across different dimensions.

## 🛠️ Steps Followed

1. **🔍 Data Aggregation and Cleaning**: Data was processed using **Power Query** to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and aggregate relevant fields.
2. **📈 Metric Calculation**: Key performance indicators (**KPIs**) were computed to provide meaningful business insights.
3. **📊 Visualization & Dashboard Development**: An interactive dashboard was created to allow users to analyze performance by different dimensions such as **country, month, and product type**.

## 📌 Key Metrics

The dashboard focuses on the following metrics:

- **💰 Gross Profit**: The total revenue minus the cost of goods sold, representing the actual earnings from sales.
- **📦 Quantity**: The total number of units sold.
- **💵 Sales**: The total revenue generated from product sales.

Additionally, we incorporate time-based comparisons using:

- **📅 YTD (Year-to-Date)**: Performance from the beginning of the year up to the selected date.
- **⏳ PYTD (Prior Year-to-Date)**: Performance during the same period in the previous year.
- **📊 GP% (Gross Profit Percentage)**: The ratio of Gross Profit to Sales, indicating profitability.

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights

Each visualization in the dashboard offers a unique perspective on business performance:

### **🚨 Bottom 10 YTD vs PYTD | Country**

- Identifies the countries with the worst performance in the current year compared to the previous year.
- Helps prioritize strategic interventions in underperforming markets.

### **📊 Value YTD vs PYTD | Month - Country - Product**

- Enables targeted decision-making by identifying seasonal trends and market shifts.

### **📉 Value YTD & PYTD | Month**

- Displays the selected metric for each month of the current year versus the same month in the previous year.
- Useful for detecting performance patterns and assessing the impact of seasonal fluctuations.

### **📌 Account Profitability Segmentation | GP% and Value**

- A scatter plot where each point represents an account.
- The X-axis shows the selected metric (**YTD**), and the Y-axis represents **GP%**.
- Helps identify high-value accounts and assess profitability distribution across customers.

## 🚀 Business Impact
